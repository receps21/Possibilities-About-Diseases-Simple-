# Possibilities-About-Diseases-Simple-
Hello there!  I created a very simple diagnosis tool, based on symptoms. To be honest, I am really new about python, that's why this project is so basic and I created it with GoogleColab.  Let's talk about the project;  You are giving symptom /symptoms and it is gathering possible diseases about symptoms.  As I said before this is so basic, but in the future, I want to do something with fine-tuning.  E.g: I'm not a doctor, only I am a big fan of House M.D. :)
